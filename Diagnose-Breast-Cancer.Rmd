## Objective
We will use mammogram screenings from 2,392,998 women in order to predict whether the patient is in risk of breast cancer. 

Data for this study was obtained from the BCSC Data Resource. More information regarding this resource is available at: http://breastscreening.cancer.gov/.

## Gathering and Processing Data

We modified the feature names in order to have more meaninful names rather than acronyms that might be hard to understand. 
```{r}
mammogram = read.csv("risk.csv")
names(mammogram) <- c("menopause","age.group","breast.density","race","hispanic","bmi","age.first.birth","relatives.with.bc","breast.procedure","last.mammogram","surgical.menopause","hormone.therapy","invasive.bc","cancer","training","count")

sum(is.na(mammogram))
```


```{r}
summary(mammogram)
```
